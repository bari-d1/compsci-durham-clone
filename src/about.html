            <p>
                <br>We are one of Durhamâ€™s newest academic departments, having split from the School of Engineering and <br> 
                Computer Science in 2017, we have rapidly grown to be a thriving home for staff, undergraduates, <br>
                postgraduates, and visitors. <br><br>

                We are located in the beautiful city of Durham and are now set up in a brand new purpose-built <br>
                building along with the Department of Mathematical Sciences. <br><br>

                We offer a range of Programmes, our undergraduate degree is available as either a 3 year BSc <br>
                or a 4 year MEng and contribute to three taught postgraduate courses: Scientific Computing (MISCADA), Business<br>
                Analytics, and Data Science. We also have a thriving research culture involving faculty, postdoctoral<br>
                researchers, and postgraduate research students. <br><br>

                Our research strengths include theoretical computer science, computer vision, AI, high-performance & <br>
                scientific computing, digital humanities, health, and networks. And our strong alumni network contributes to<br>
                the department in many ways - including our External Advisory Board, visiting speakers, student <br>
                placements, and philanthropic support of scholarships. We have some hugely influential alumni in the Tech <br>
                Sector.
